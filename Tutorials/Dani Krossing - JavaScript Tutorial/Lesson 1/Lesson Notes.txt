	- When a website is loaded into a browser, it is done so in three different layers:
		- The content layer (HTML):
			- Consists of the content of the website, and the HTML wrapped around it.
			- It is loaded when the page loads.
		- The presentation layer (CSS):
			- Consists of CSS that is applied to the HTML in order to make the website prettier.
			- It is loaded when the page loads.
		- The Interactive layer (JavaScript):
			- This is what interacts with HTML and CSS to change what one can see and do inside a website.
			- Continuously runs in the background of the website in real time both when and after the page is loaded.
			- It can make changes to the website any time without needing to refresh the browser.
